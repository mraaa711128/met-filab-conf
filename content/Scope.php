        <!-- <p class="lead">This is the 2nd International Conference on â€œBig data in Economics, Science and Technology" (BEST).</p> -->
        <p class="lead">BEST 2015 is an international interdisciplinary conference combining aspects of economics, science, and technology to address complex societal issues that we face today on a global scale.</p>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
            <p class="lead">Stability and sustainability of economic systems is an important issue in the current climate of high uncertainty for the future of global economy. In addition to stable financial systems, economic sustainability also depends on reliable health care systems, secure computer networks, dependable transportation, and solid infrastructure, to name a few. In this environment, science and technology play an important role in modeling and forecasting future economic outcomes.</p>
            <p class="lead">Statistical physics and network theory offer new analytical approaches to study economic development and interconnectivity of the underlying systems comprising the global economy.</p>
            <p class="lead">Using complexity science, research efforts have recently been conducted in many aspects of global financial systems, health care, transportation, and infrastructure. Some studies show how economic networks are interconnected, some develop network tools to measure risk propagation through these networks, yet some concentrate on data mining, spreading the wing of researchers who explore, analyze, and investigate wide range of global economic data available today.</p>
            <p class="lead">This conference intends to cover these aspects, attracting researchers from various scientific fields. Some of the topics covered at the conference are:</p>
